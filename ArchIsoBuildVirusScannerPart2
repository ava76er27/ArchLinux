Arch Linux using ArchISO to create a Bootable Virus scanner to a USB drive

2.  cd to root directory and cd probaseline directory to change packages.x86_64 file.

    Next we need to add virus scanner, network manager for wifi, a ntfs driver 
    for scanning windows drive. 
    List of software to add:
    nano packages.x86_64 and add the list to bottom of packages.x86_64 file.
linux-firmware
networkmanager
network-manager-applet
clamav
ntfs-3g
nano
intel-ucode
amd-ucode
xf86-video-qxl
xf86-video-intel
xf86-video-amdgpu
xf86-video-nouveau
    cd to airootfs directory in the probaseline directory to add boot and windows directory.
     This creates the directories so we have mounts made during the ISO creation.
    We use these as mount points to scan with clamav.
cd airootfs
mkdir root
cd root
mkdir boot
mkdir windows
    We are ready to create the ISO for the USB.
cd
cd archbuild
./probaseline

    This will create the ISO in the out directory. On my Asus X200ma I'll be here awhile until it finishes.
