Arch Linux using ArchISO to create a Bootable Virus scanner to a USB drive

Using Openbox on a Asus X200ma laptop (my Old Laptop with WiFi not close to a plugin sometimes). 
1. Switching to root user and Download ArchISO using pacman.
   Make directories archbuild, probaseline, and proreleng.
   Copy Baseline and Releng directories to probaseline and proreleng directories.
   Moving to the archbuild directory and make work Directory and out Directory.

   2 scripts to build a Baseline image and a Live image.

     Build the baseline script in the Archbuild directory:
      
        mkarchiso -v -w /root/archbuild/work/ -o /root/archbuild/out/ /root/probaseline/
      
     make a file called buildbaseline.sh and make the file executable

     Build the archlinux live script in the Archbuild directory:

        mkarchiso -v -w /root/archbuild/work/ -o /root/archbuild/out/ /root/proreleng/

     make a file called buildreleng.sh and make the file executable


   1 script to test the build before writing it to a USB drive.
     In the Archbuild directory cd to out directory and make a run script.

        run_archiso -i arch*

     Make a file called run.sh script and make it executable.
      With this script we test your build before writing a USB drive.
