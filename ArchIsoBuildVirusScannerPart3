   To add your Wifi network. If your computer is connected 
   the network already you can skip ahead to freshclam.
nmtui

freshclam
   Directory stucture looks like this:
lsblk

   The commands for scanning the directories will be close to actual usage of the
   scanner.
cd ..
clamscan --recursive --infected --bell home/
