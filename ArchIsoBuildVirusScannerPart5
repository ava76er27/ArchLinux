Lots of ways to make your USB bootable


 The command for dd is simple:  after if=arch just hit (TAB) key to print name and continue with rest of
 command of=/dev/sdb bs=1M status=progress
 
dd if=arch...iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M status=progress   




    I'am still learning this and by no means an expert but with all the lack of info out there I hope this 
    helps someone.

    Take Care and have a blessed day. Be safe
